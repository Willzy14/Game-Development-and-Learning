### Multi-Session Project Status: Phase 1 Complete (Jan 8)

**Trigger:** User critique of Final Piece V2 planning revealed gap:
> "Your plan builds perfect geometry then tries to make it feel natural using only gradients. That will always produce 'perfect stone'."

**The Missing Piece:** Structure vs Weathering Pass System

**Phase 1 (Complete ✅):**
- Created **24-REALISM_DEGRADATION.md** (~1,000 lines)
- How to break perfection (edge degradation, surface variation, asymmetry)
- Edge Hierarchy (depth-based sharpness)
- Value Grouping (value-first workflow)
- Material Degradation States (stone/wood/metal progressions)
- WHEN Decision Framework (age/environment/material/exposure)
- 7 Canvas 2D implementation classes
- Complete validation checklists

**Next Steps (see `/docs/ACTIVE_WORK.md`):**
- Phase 2: Test with Pong (validate decision-graph navigation)
- Phase 3: Create DECISION_GRAPH.md (formalize navigation system)
- Phase 4: Update related Bible documents (integration)

### Last Session Summary (Jan 8 - Planning System Formalized)

**Part 1: Research Synthesis**
1. ✅ User feedback: "expand from 2 to 5+ sources per topic" → Gathered 15+ total
2. ✅ Created 18-COMPOSITION_THEORY.md (700+ lines)
3. ✅ Created 19-COLOR_HARMONY.md (650+ lines)
4. ✅ Created 20-ART_STYLES.md (700+ lines)
5. ✅ All documents answer WHY techniques work (perceptual science)

**Part 2: Theory Validation**
1. ✅ Created PLANNING-V2.md (planning document pattern)
2. ✅ Implemented Final Piece V2 with theory-applied code
3. ✅ Golden Ratio composition + Split-complementary harmony + Stylized realism
4. ✅ Validated: Planning docs reduce cognitive load dramatically
5. ✅ Pattern works: Reference Bible docs AS NEEDED (don't memorize)

**Part 3: System Formalization**
1. ✅ Added Rule 13 to CORE_RULES.md (Planning Documents for Complex Projects)
2. ✅ Updated BIBLE_INDEX.md with Rule 13 summary
3. ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive formalization entry
4. ✅ Updated SESSION_LOG.md with validation insights
5. ✅ Planning System now locked as foundation for scaling knowledge

**User Decision:** Option B chosen - "lets get that planning system locked and crack on with the rest of the research"

### Key Insights Discovered

**Composition Science:**
> "Rules like Golden Ratio/Rule of Thirds work because they exploit Gestalt principles + eye tracking patterns. First 2 seconds = eye JUMPS to high-contrast (doesn't scan smoothly)."

**Color Mathematics:**
> "Warm colors focus in FRONT of retina, cool BEHIND (physical phenomenon). Temperature contrast creates depth perception. Complementary colors need 70-30 ratio to avoid optical vibration."

**Style Spectrum:**
> "Photorealism vs cartoon is SPECTRUM, not skill ladder—Picasso proves this. Style = deliberate choices about how to represent reality, not technical limitation."

**Planning System Validation:**
> "The planning document is a MAP that shows WHERE in the Bible docs to look when you need specific information. You don't memorize the map - you USE it to navigate. External memory vs working memory = cognitive offloading."

### Next Phase Options

**Option A: Phase 3 Research (Character & Integration)**
- Character art fundamentals (gesture, anatomy, expression)
- Game art integration (sprites, animations, consistency across assets)
- Art direction (creating cohesive visual identity)

**Workflow for Research:**
1. Gather 5+ sources per topic (like Phase 1)
2. Synthesize into Bible documents (answer WHY, HOW, WHEN, VALIDATE)
3. Include Canvas 2D implementations
4. For complex applications: Create planning doc BEFORE coding (Rule 13)
5. Validate through practice, document learnings

---

## Next Session: Continue Phase 2/3 Research

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with Phase 2 research (Classical Techniques, Landscape Masters, Environmental Storytelling)
2. Gather 5+ sources per topic (like Phase 1: 15+ sources total)
3. Synthesize into new Bible documents (21-CLASSICAL_TECHNIQUES.md, 22-LANDSCAPE_MASTERS.md, 23-ENVIRONMENTAL_STORYTELLING.md)
4. Include Canvas 2D implementations and validation checklists
5. If needed for complex validation: Create planning doc using Rule 13 workflow

**Alternative Options:**
- Continue Phase 3 research (Character Art, Game Integration)
- Final reflection on unknown unknowns
- Apply research to Tier 3 game (character control with art mastery)

**READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

1. **Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` FIRST** - Understand WHY we do things this way
2. Read `docs/bible/01-CORE_RULES.md` - Rule 13 is NEW (Planning Documents)
3. Read `docs/bible/BIBLE_INDEX.md` - Contains hard rules and repository map
4. Read `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` - Jan 8 entries (Part 1, 2, 3) show research workflow
5. Check `docs/FAILURE_ARCHIVE.md` - Past mistakes to avoid
6. **See `/art-studies/008-final-piece/PLANNING-V2.md`** - Planning document example

**Key Files:**
- Space Scene V1: `art-studies/004-space-scene/art.js`
- Jungle Theme: `games/tier-2-core-mechanics/005-flappy-bird/005-flappy-bird-v5-jungle/jungle-theme.js`
- Canvas Repos: `docs/external-resources/RESOURCE_LIBRARY.md`
- Core Rules: `docs/bible/01-CORE_RULES.md`

**AT SESSION END:**
1. Update `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` with what was learned
2. Update this file with current state (ALWAYS reference DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md at the top)
3. Git commit and push

- **Tech Stack:** JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API

## Key Rules (Read Full List in Bible)

1. Incremental development - ONE feature at a time
2. Backup before changes
3. HTML IDs before JavaScript
4. Test after EVERY change
5. NEVER be lazy - always push for improvement
6. **Rule 12**: Never Self-Censor Vision (ask for chunking, don't hold back)
7. **Rule 12.1**: Art Protocols Apply Everywhere (games = art pieces)

## Documentation System

- All Bible docs have **staleness metadata** (Last Updated / Last Validated dates)
- Documents >60 days old should be validated before use
- Rule changes are tracked in `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md`
