# Tier 2: Core Mechanics

## Learning Objectives
Build on fundamentals with more dynamic gameplay:
- Continuous scrolling/movement
- Procedural generation basics
- Timing-based gameplay
- Object pooling
- Difficulty scaling
- Game over and restart flow
- More complex state management

## Target Games (2-3 projects)

### Suggested Projects
1. **Flappy Bird Clone**
   - One-button control, procedural pipe generation, score tracking
   - Skills: Gravity simulation, gap generation, endless gameplay
   
2. **Endless Runner** (Temple Run style)
   - Auto-scrolling, lane switching, obstacle patterns
   - Skills: Scrolling backgrounds, pattern design, speed increases

3. **Space Shooter** (Top-down, simple)
   - Player movement, shooting, enemy waves
   - Skills: Projectiles, spawn patterns, health systems

## Technology Recommendation
- Continue with chosen tech from Tier 1
- If using Unity, introduce Prefabs and basic Coroutines

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Gameplay feels responsive
- [ ] Procedural generation creates playable content
- [ ] Difficulty increases over time
- [ ] Game has clear feedback (sounds, particles, screen shake)
- [ ] Multiple play sessions feel different

## Common Pitfalls at This Tier
- Random generation that's unfair to players
- Not balancing difficulty curve
- Ignoring "game feel" (feedback, juice, polish)
- Overusing tutorials instead of experimenting

## Skills That Should "Click"
- How timing affects gameplay feel
- Importance of procedural variation
- Basic balance and difficulty design
