# Space Invaders V2 - Improvement Pass

## What's Being Improved

### Issues from V1
1. ❌ Basic visuals (just rectangles)
2. ❌ No particle effects on explosions
3. ❌ No screen shake on impacts
4. ❌ Sound plays identically every time
5. ❌ Collision code not extracted to shared library
6. ❌ No shields/cover (classic feature missing)
7. ❌ Minimal playtesting led to bug (enemy shooting)

### V2 Additions
1. ✅ **Particle system** for enemy explosions
2. ✅ **Screen shake** on player hits and wave completion
3. ✅ **Sound pitch variation** for more variety
4. ✅ **Destructible shields** (4 barriers like classic game)
5. ✅ **Collision utilities extracted** to shared library
6. ✅ **Visual feedback improvements** (flashing, color changes)
7. ✅ **Proper playtesting** before marking complete
8. ✅ **Hit pause** on enemy destruction for impact
9. ✅ **Transition animations** between states

## Goals
- Apply lessons learned immediately
- Practice visual polish skills
- Extract reusable collision code
- Demonstrate difference polish makes

## Time Budget
~3-4 hours (improvements + testing + documentation)
