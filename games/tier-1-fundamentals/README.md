# Tier 1: Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
Master the absolute basics of game development:
- Understanding the game loop (update, render, input)
- Basic physics (position, velocity, collision detection)
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse)
- Score tracking and game state
- Win/lose conditions
- UI basics

## Target Games (2-3 projects)

### Suggested Projects
1. **Pong**
   - Two paddles, ball physics, score tracking
   - Skills: Collision detection, basic AI, score UI
   
2. **Breakout / Brick Breaker**
   - Paddle, ball, breakable blocks
   - Skills: Grid layout, object destruction, level completion

3. **Guess the Number / Simple Quiz**
   - Input validation, random generation, game state
   - Skills: Logic flow, restart mechanics, UI feedback

## Technology Recommendation
- **Option A**: Start with vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas (lower learning curve)
- **Option B**: Jump to Unity + C# (consistency for entire journey, steeper start)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Game runs without crashes
- [ ] Core mechanics work as intended
- [ ] Player can win and lose
- [ ] Score/feedback is displayed
- [ ] Game can restart

## Common Pitfalls at This Tier
- Over-complicating simple mechanics
- Not testing frequently enough
- Skipping the "boring" UI/menu work
- Moving on before mechanics feel good
