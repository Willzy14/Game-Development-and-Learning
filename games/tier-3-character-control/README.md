# Tier 3: Character Control

## Learning Objectives
Deep dive into movement and combat systems:
- Complex character controllers (8-direction, platforming)
- Projectile systems
- Enemy AI basics
- Health and damage systems
- Animation state machines
- Camera following
- Level design fundamentals

## Target Games (2-3 projects)

### Suggested Projects
1. **Top-Down Shooter / Twin-Stick Shooter**
   - 8-directional movement, aiming, shooting
   - Skills: Vector math, raycasting, enemy behaviors, health bars
   
2. **2D Platformer** (Mario/Celeste style)
   - Jump physics, ground detection, moving platforms
   - Skills: Coyote time, jump buffering, acceleration curves, level design

3. **Beat 'em Up** (Simple, like Streets of Rage)
   - Melee combat, hit detection, combo systems
   - Skills: Attack animations, hitboxes, enemy groups

## Technology Recommendation
- Unity highly recommended from this tier onward
- Start learning about ScriptableObjects for data management
- Explore Cinemachine for camera control

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Controls feel tight and responsive
- [ ] Combat has clear feedback and impact
- [ ] AI enemies present meaningful challenge
- [ ] Level design supports gameplay mechanics
- [ ] Character animations enhance gameplay

## Common Pitfalls at This Tier
- Fighting physics engine instead of understanding it
- Over-complex AI that's buggy
- Ignoring level design in favor of "more features"
- Not playtesting movement feel enough
- Scope creep (adding too many enemy types, weapons, etc.)

## Skills That Should "Click"
- How movement parameters affect game feel
- Importance of "coyote time" and input buffering
- State machines for character logic
- Separation of data and behavior

## Code Patterns to Learn
- State Machine (for character states)
- Object Pooling (for bullets, enemies)
- Event System (for game events)
