# Tier 5: Polish & Complexity

## Learning Objectives
Create games with professional feel and complex features:
- Advanced animation systems (blend trees, IK)
- Cinematic sequences
- Complex ability systems
- Interconnected level design
- Audio design and mixing
- Visual effects and shaders
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features

## Target Games (2-3 projects)

### Suggested Projects
1. **Metroidvania**
   - Ability gating, interconnected map, backtracking, save rooms
   - Skills: Map systems, ability unlocks, complex level design, Cinemachine

2. **Action-Adventure** (Zelda-like)
   - Combat, puzzles, NPCs, quests, boss fights
   - Skills: Dialogue systems, quest tracking, boss patterns, cutscenes

3. **Real-Time Strategy** (Simplified RTS)
   - Unit selection, resource gathering, building, combat
   - Skills: Multi-unit control, fog of war, AI skirmish

## Technology Recommendation
- Unity with full production pipeline
- Shader Graph for visual effects
- Timeline for cutscenes
- Post-processing stack
- Addressables for asset management (optional)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Game feels polished and complete
- [ ] All systems are balanced and tuned
- [ ] Visual and audio design enhance experience
- [ ] Performance is optimized for target platform
- [ ] Game is "shippable" (could be released)
- [ ] Includes accessibility options

## Common Pitfalls at This Tier
- Endless polish without shipping
- Ignoring performance for visual fidelity
- Feature creep in late development
- Not getting external playtesting feedback
- Burnout from long development cycles

## Skills That Should "Click"
- How to scope and cut features ruthlessly
- Importance of polish on existing features vs. new features
- Production pipeline and asset management
- When "good enough" is actually good enough

## Code Patterns to Learn
- Service Locator Pattern
- Dependency Injection basics
- State Machines (hierarchical)
- Data-driven design at scale

## Polish Techniques to Master
- Screen shake and camera effects
- Particle systems for juice
- Sound design and audio mixing
- Animation blending and transitions
- UI/UX flow and feedback
- Performance profiling and optimization

## This is the Gateway Tier
Games completed here should be portfolio-worthy. This is where you transition from "learning" to "producing."
