## ⚠️ CURRENT ACTIVE TASK (January 6, 2026 - V8 Landscape Incremental Improvements)

**Art Study Series - Landscape V8 (Problem-First Approach)**

We discovered that **more techniques ≠ better results**. V7 implemented everything and was WORSE than V5. Now using incremental approach.

| Status | Version | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ✅ Base | V5 | Proven foundation - 5-value system, form shadows, compositing |
| ❌ Failed | V7 | Over-engineered - noise library, material system, validation → muddy output |
| 🔄 Active | V8 | Problem-first incremental improvements on V5 base |

**Current V8 State:**
- ✅ Change #1: Mountain ridge edges (lineTo → quadraticCurveTo) - organic curves
- ⏳ Next: Test tree edge variation (code exists), water ripples, far mountain softening

**Key Lesson Learned Today:**
> "Small incremental changes add up to big improvements. Start with the most obvious problem, fix it, reassess. May take 100 small changes to get the best result." (Mixing/mastering analogy)

**Key Files:**
- V8 Code: `art-studies/002-landscape-v8/art.js`
- V5 Reference: `art-studies/002-landscape-v5/art.js`
- Technique Selection: `docs/bible/16-TECHNIQUE_SELECTION.md` ⭐ READ THIS
- Session Log: `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md`

**To Continue:**
1. Start server: `cd art-studies/002-landscape-v8 && python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8080
3. Identify ONE visible problem
4. Apply ONE targeted fix
5. Test: Is it CLEARLY better? Keep. Unclear? Revert.
6. Repeat

**READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

1. Read `docs/bible/16-TECHNIQUE_SELECTION.md` - ⚠️ NEW! Prevents V7-style over-engineering
2. Read `docs/bible/BIBLE_INDEX.md` - Contains hard rules and repository map
3. Check `docs/FAILURE_ARCHIVE.md` - Past mistakes to avoid (V7 is now here!)
4. Check `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` - Recent session history

These documents contain non-negotiable rules learned through painful debugging. Breaking them wastes hours.

**AT SESSION END:**
1. Update `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` with what was learned
2. Update `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md` if any rules or docs changed

## Quick Context

- **Project:** Game Development Learning Journey
- **Current State:** Tier 1 Complete (Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Snake + V2 editions)
- **Side Quest:** Art Study Series (3 of 8 complete)
- **Next Game:** Tier 2 - Core Mechanics
- **Tech Stack:** JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API

## Key Rules (Read Full List in Bible)

1. Incremental development - ONE feature at a time
2. Backup before changes
3. HTML IDs before JavaScript
4. Test after EVERY change
5. NEVER be lazy - always push for improvement

## Documentation System

- All Bible docs have **staleness metadata** (Last Updated / Last Validated dates)
- Documents >60 days old should be validated before use
- Rule changes are tracked in `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md`
