## ⚠️ CURRENT ACTIVE TASK (January 5, 2026)

**Art Study Series - Mastering Texture & Detail**

We are working through 8 standalone art pieces to build texture skills.

| Status | Next Action |
|--------|-------------|
| Study #1 Egyptian Scene | ✅ Complete (needs review/rating) |
| Study #2 Landscape | ⏳ Not Started - DO THIS NEXT |

**Files:**
- Progress Tracker: `docs/art-studies/ART_STUDY_PROGRESS.md`
- Study #1: `art-studies/001-egyptian-scene/`

**Goal:** Each picture pushes detail higher. Key skill = TEXTURE

---

**READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

1. Read `docs/bible/BIBLE_INDEX.md` - Contains hard rules and repository map
2. Check `docs/FAILURE_ARCHIVE.md` - Past mistakes to avoid
3. Check `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` - Recent session history

These documents contain non-negotiable rules learned through painful debugging. Breaking them wastes hours.

**AT SESSION END:**
1. Update `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` with what was learned
2. Update `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md` if any rules or docs changed
