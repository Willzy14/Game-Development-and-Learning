**READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

1. Read `docs/bible/BIBLE_INDEX.md` - Contains hard rules and repository map
2. Check `docs/FAILURE_ARCHIVE.md` - Past mistakes to avoid
3. Check `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` - Recent session history

These documents contain non-negotiable rules learned through painful debugging. Breaking them wastes hours.

**AT SESSION END:**
1. Update `docs/bible/09-SESSION_LOG.md` with what was learned
2. Update `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md` if any rules or docs changed
