### Key Insight Internalized

> "Most bad generative art comes from 'Look how much I can do'.
> Most good generative art comes from 'Look how little I need'."

**Research Directive for repo study:**
```
For each repository:
- Identify the render order
- Identify where structure is locked
- Identify where randomness is constrained
- Identify what is intentionally NOT done
```

## Next Session Options

### Option 1: Art Study #8 V2 - Final Polish Pass (RECOMMENDED)
- Mountain Shrine at Dawn needs upgrade
- Apply learned techniques more thoroughly
- Add one key missing element (what makes it "complete"?)

### Option 2: Continue Tier 2 Games
- Create another Flappy Bird theme (modular architecture)
- Or move to next Tier 2 game
- Art studies foundation is now SOLID

### Option 3: Retrospective + Documentation
- Document art study series lessons
- Update DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY with art insights
- Prepare for game development sprint

**READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

1. **Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` FIRST** - Understand WHY we do things this way
2. Read `docs/bible/01-CORE_RULES.md` - Rules 12 & 12.1 are NEW
3. Read `docs/bible/BIBLE_INDEX.md` - Contains hard rules and repository map
4. Read `docs/external-resources/RESOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - Canvas art repos section (NEW)
5. Check `docs/FAILURE_ARCHIVE.md` - Past mistakes to avoid

**Key Files:**
- Space Scene V1: `art-studies/004-space-scene/art.js`
- Jungle Theme: `games/tier-2-core-mechanics/005-flappy-bird/005-flappy-bird-v5-jungle/jungle-theme.js`
- Canvas Repos: `docs/external-resources/RESOURCE_LIBRARY.md`
- Core Rules: `docs/bible/01-CORE_RULES.md`

2. Update this file with current state (ALWAYS reference DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md at the top)
3. Git commit and push

## Quick Context

- **Project:** Game Development Learning Journey
- **Current State:** Tier 1 Complete (Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Snake + V2 editions)
- **Side Quest:** Art Study Series (4 of 8 started)

- **Tech Stack:** JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API

## Key Rules (Read Full List in Bible)

1. Incremental development - ONE feature at a time
2. Backup before changes
3. HTML IDs before JavaScript
4. Test after EVERY change
5. NEVER be lazy - always push for improvement
6. **Rule 12**: Never Self-Censor Vision (ask for chunking, don't hold back)
7. **Rule 12.1**: Art Protocols Apply Everywhere (games = art pieces)

## Documentation System

- All Bible docs have **staleness metadata** (Last Updated / Last Validated dates)
- Documents >60 days old should be validated before use
- Rule changes are tracked in `docs/bible/CHANGELOG.md`
