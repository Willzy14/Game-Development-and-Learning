### Two Active Tracks

**Track A: Art Studies (Restraint Focus)**
| # | Subject | Status | Key Learning |
|---|---------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Egyptian Scene | ✅ Complete | Texture variety, weathering |
| 2 | Mountain Landscape | ✅ V8.4 Complete | Problem-first incremental changes |
| 3 | Character Portrait | ✅ V3 Complete | Chibi proportions, style consistency |
| 4 | Space Scene | 🔄 V1 Created | **"Look how little I need"** - restraint principle |

**Track B: Tier 2 Games (Ready)**
- Flappy Bird Egypt (V4) - ✅ Complete
- Flappy Bird Jungle (V5) - ✅ Complete with full art protocols

### Tonight's Session Summary (Jan 7)

1. ✅ Created jungle theme with full art protocols (fireflies, light rays, mushrooms, mist)
2. ✅ Added Rule 12 (Never Self-Censor Vision) and Rule 12.1 (Art Protocols Apply Everywhere)
3. ✅ Documented curated Canvas art repos in RESOURCE_LIBRARY.md
4. ✅ Created Space Scene V1 with restraint principle

### Key Insight Internalized

> "Most bad generative art comes from 'Look how much I can do'.
> Most good generative art comes from 'Look how little I need'."

**Research Directive for repo study:**
```
For each repository:
- Identify the render order
- Identify where structure is locked
- Identify where randomness is constrained
- Identify what is intentionally NOT done
```

### Option 2: Underwater Scene V1 (New Art Study)
- Apply same restraint principle to new subject
- Caustic light, coral, particles
