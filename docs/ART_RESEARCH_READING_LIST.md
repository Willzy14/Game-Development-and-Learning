## 🎯 Success Criteria

### How Do I Know I'm Ready?

**Before upgrading the final piece, I must be able to answer:**

1. ✅ WHY is the shrine centered? (Should it be on a third?)
2. ✅ WHAT color harmony system am I using? (Intentional choice)
3. ✅ WHY are all elements in the same style? (Consistency check)
4. ✅ WHAT story do the texture details tell? (Narrative purpose)
5. ✅ WHERE does the viewer's eye go first? (Visual flow plan)
6. ✅ HOW does the composition direct attention? (Leading lines identified)
7. ✅ WHAT makes this "game art" not "painting"? (Functional design)

**If I can't answer these with SPECIFIC techniques, I'm not ready.**
