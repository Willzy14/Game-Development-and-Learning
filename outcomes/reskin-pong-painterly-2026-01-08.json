    "Broken color technique (20 dabs per ball) created painterly feel without losing ball recognition",

    "Impasto paddle texture added visual interest without cluttering",

  "keep_for_future": [
    "Preserve all game logic when doing reskins - ONLY modify render functions",
    "Test gameplay after each visual change to ensure no regressions",
    "Broken color (multiple dabs) works better than gradients for painterly style",
    "Silhouette protection prevents over-decoration in game objects",
    "Use complementary colors for critical game elements (ball vs paddles)",
    "Reference real art (Monet) to maintain style authenticity",
    "Layer color patches rather than smooth blends",
    "Keep brushstroke direction consistent (suggests light source)",

  "avoid_for_future": [
    "Don't modify game logic 'for realism' in reskin projects",
    "Don't use smooth linear gradients in painterly style - kills the effect",
    "Don't over-noise shapes - ball must remain recognizable",
    "Don't add particle systems without requirement - scope creep",
    "Don't forget to test collision detection after visual changes",
    "Don't apply degradation to modern objects (age check first)",
